#Partial Report Psychological Test

This is one of George Sperling's tests that demonstrate iconic memory. So far, this test is limited to an auditorily cued recall of a 3x3 grid. 
A detailed description of iconic memory can be found on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconic_memory)
